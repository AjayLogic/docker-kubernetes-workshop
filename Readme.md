Huge shout out to the work [Kelsey Hightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/) does in the kubernetes community, and providing his [intro to kubernetes](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/intro-to-kubernetes-workshop) workshop on github.com I've used some of the `inspector` app RC and service definitions to illustrate the respective concepts.
